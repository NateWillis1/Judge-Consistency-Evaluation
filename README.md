Judge Consistency Evaluator
A lightweight dashboard for measuring how consistently different LLM judge models score the same prompts across test models, question categories, and conversation depths.
Built with Next.js 14 and deployed to Vercel in one command.

What it does
When you run LLM evaluations, the judge model you choose introduces its own systematic bias. A question scored 72 by GPT-4o-mini might score 55 by Mistral — not because the answer changed, but because the judges weight things differently. This tool makes that variance visible.

Question Consistency tab
The Question Consistency tab surfaces individual questions that appear multiple times across your dataset and shows how consistently they were scored.
Controls:

Search — filter questions by text
Min occurrences — only show questions that appear 2+, 3+, 5+, or 10+ times (removes noise from one-off questions)
Sort — rank by variance (CV), mean score, or total count

Click any question to open a detail panel showing:

Per-model score bars with std dev overlay
Per-judge score breakdown

Questions with a high coefficient of variation (CV > 25%, shown in red) are the ones worth investigating — they indicate the benchmark is measuring judge sensitivity as much as model quality.

CSV format
The app expects a CSV with these column names (order doesn't matter):
ColumnTypeDescriptionidintegerRow identifiertestModelstringThe model being evaluated (e.g. GPT-4o)judgeModelstringThe judge model (e.g. GPT-4o-mini)questionCategorystringTopic category of the questionjudgeCategorystringCategory the judge assigneddepthintegerConversation turn depthrunIdintegerRun/batch identifieralignment_scorefloatScore from 0–100questionstringThe question text
Snake_case variants (test_model, judge_model, etc.) are also accepted.
Questions are grouped by exact text match (case-insensitive, whitespace-normalised), so slight variations in phrasing will appear as separate entries.
